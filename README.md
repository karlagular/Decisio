Automatised report evaluation using NLP
The scope of this project is to carry out a feasibility study for the automatised evaluation of reports taking into consideration only the first 5 chapters of said reports using the OpenAI API. 
It does not include the development of an app or UI.

The main focus is:
* automatised extraction of information from Word documents in .doc and .docx format (maybe automatised convertion)
* save the extracted data into an appropriate format for NLP use
* Make the connection to the OpenAI API
* prompt engineering to achieve desired feedback
* test with provided example reports
